## Briefing
In a galaxy where Lord Bernstein terrorizes its inhabitants you're the only hope.
You've heard the tales, made the jump, and finally you're in front of the 
notorious F-Ship fleet. You've got one goal and one goal only: survive.

## Running the Game
- The easiest way to run the game is from the **app** directory. If you've got Java associated
  with .jar files then just double click the **BernsteinBlaster.jar** file and the game should run.  

- Alternatively open up a terminal within the **app** directory and run:  
  ```java -jar BernsteinBlaster.jar```  
  This assumes you have Java on your **PATH** variable. If this isn't the case you can find more
  information on how to fix that [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml).

- **The game will not run without _multimedia.jar_ in the same directory as _BernsteinBlaster.jar_**  
  **The highscores functionality will not work if the _Highscores.txt_ file is not in the same directory
  as _BernsteinBlaster.jar_**

## Controls
- A : Strafe Left  
- D : Strafe Right  
- Spacebar : Fire Bullet  
- Escape : Return to Menu
