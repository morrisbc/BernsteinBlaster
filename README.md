## Acknowledgements
- Huge thanks to [Professor David Bernstein](https://users.cs.jmu.edu/bernstdh/Web/index.html)
  for allowing us to use his multimedia library and showing us the ropes in CS349. Without the
  help and resources this wouldn't be possible.

## Other Notes
- The window dimensions are locked at 1280 x 720 so if you're running a lower resolution
  monitor our apologies.
- Highscores assume that the 'Highscores.txt' file is in the same directory as the jar file 
  (assuming you're running the application from the jar file which can be found [here]())
